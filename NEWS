# Version 0.1.2

* Introduces further customization for the Upset-plot and Venn diagram parts:
    - Allow explicitly control maximum number of intersects
    - Allow ordering Upset plot on degree
    - Both Venn and Upset plots can be filtered on a combination of p/FDR-value and fold change
* Omits less informative contra-regulation fraction/p-threshold illustrations for overlap
