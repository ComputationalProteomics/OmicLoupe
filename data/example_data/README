This data contains controlled spike-in proteomic levels processed with two different software -
"DIA Umpire" and "OpenSwath".

This data is based on data obtained from the publication:

"A multi-center study benchmarks software tools for label-free proteome quantification"

Available from: https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3685 (doi: 10.1038/nbt.3685)

The data used for input to the manuscript was retrieved from ProteomeXchange ID PXD002952 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002952)

If this data is used in any meaningful way in other studies, this is the publication to cite.
